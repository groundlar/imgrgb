=======
Program to use all RGB colors in a single image, based off [József Fejes ideas] (http://joco.name/2014/03/02/all-rgb-colors-in-one-image/)

The base algorithm is similar to what is described by József Fejes in his blog posts and the [stackoverflow puzzle](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/22144/images-with-all-colors). This version is implemented in Java, and has a variety of possible color distance metrics. Attempts were also made to create a more visually pleasing aesthetic by modifying the pixel placement algorithm. Output and a better algorithm description to follow.
